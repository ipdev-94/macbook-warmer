# MacBook Warmer

> Because Apple spent millions engineering thermal efficiency, and you just want warm legs.

Your MacBook M3 is a marvel of modern engineering — whisper-quiet, power-efficient, and **freezing cold in winter**. This script fixes that by doing what Apple tried so hard to prevent: making your CPU sweat.

## The Problem

It's cold. Your lap is cold. Your MacBook is sitting there at 35°C like a smug little aluminum ice pack. You didn't pay $1,599+ for a *cooling pad*.

## The Solution

A mass of busy loops spinning on your CPU cores. No crypto mining. No protein folding. No contribution to science whatsoever. Just pure, unapologetic, thermal output directed straight into your thighs.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipdev-94/macbook-warmer.git
cd macbook-warmer
chmod +x warmup.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start warming (6 cores by default)
./warmup.sh
./warmup.sh 4
./warmup.sh 8
./warmup.sh stop
# ...or just Ctrl+C
```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this bad for my MacBook?**
A: No. Your Mac already throttles itself. It is built for this — it just did not *know* it was built for this.

**Q: Will this void my warranty?**
A: No more than running Chrome with 47 tabs.

**Q: Can I use this on an Intel MacBook?**
A: You don't need to. Those were already space heaters.

**Q: My cat keeps sitting on my laptop now.**
A: That's not a question, but you're welcome.

**Q: Is there a Windows version?**
A: Yes.

## Requirements

- A MacBook (M1/M2/M3/M4, any variant)
- Cold weather
- A willingness to mass murder your battery
- bash (pre-installed on macOS)

## Contributing

Found a way to make it even less efficient? PRs welcome. Bonus points if you can make the TouchBar warm too.

## License

[MIT](License)— Do whatever you want with it. Considered requiring payment for commercial use, but anyone who pays money for a commercial license to warm up their laptop deserves a refund and a blanket.
